## Game Mechanics

The game revolves around balancing your **energy** and **knowledge**.

- **Energy:** Regenerated by sleeping. It's a key resource for progression.
- **Knowledge:** Gained by studying. Reaching certain knowledge thresholds allows you to rank up.
- **Ranks:** You start as a "child" and progress through various stages of learning, from "student" to "god" and beyond. Each rank has a knowledge requirement.
- **Upgrades:** You can improve your "study habits" and "study power" to accelerate your knowledge acquisition.

## Planned Features

- ~Implement a timer for passive resource generation.~
- ~Add visual effects for ranking up and clicking.~
- ~Create a running log of game events.~
- ~Add tooltips to UI elements for better guidance.~
- Balance the energy consumption and regeneration mechanics.
